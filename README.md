## What is Filter Forge?

### Getting Started Guide
Step-by-step tutorial covering filter installation, in-game setup, basic syntax, and first edits.

## Tech Stack

- Pure HTML/CSS/JS — no frameworks, no build step
- Static site deployable to GitHub Pages
- All data inline or in local JSON files (works from `file://`)
- Dark Diablo 2 themed design with gold accents

## Running Locally

Open `index.html` directly in a browser — all features work from `file://` protocol.

For full functionality (live community filter fetching), you can also serve via HTTP:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.

## Deploying

Push to GitHub and enable Pages (Settings > Pages > Source: GitHub Actions). The included workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` handles deployment automatically.
